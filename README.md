# gradle-play-publisher

Gradle plugin to upload your release APKs to the Google Play Store. Needs the ```com.android.application``` plugin applied. Supports the Android Application Plugin as of version ```0.12.2```.

## Requirements

To use the publisher plugin you have to create a service account for your existing Google Play Account. See https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started for more information.

Once you finished the setup you have a so called *service account email address* and a *p12 key file* that we will use later on.

## Usage

Add it to your buildscript dependencies:

```groovy
buildscript {

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.triplet.gradle:play-publisher:0.0.2'
    }
}
```

Apply it:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'play'
```

## Configuration

Once you have applied this plugin to your android application project you can configure it via the ```play``` closure. Drop in your service account email address and the p12 key file you generated in the API Console here.

```groovy
play {
    serviceAccountEmail = 'your-service-account-email'
    pk12File = file('key.p12')
}
```

As a default your APK is published to the alpha track and you can promote it to beta or production manually. If you want to directly publish to another track you can specify it via the ```track``` property:

```groovy
play {
    // ...
    track = 'production' // or 'beta' or 'alpha'
}
```


## Run

The plugin adds a publish task for every flavor of your app. So in the most simple case (where there are no flavors at all) that would be ```publishRelease```. If there are flavors like *free* and *paid* you would get the tasks ```publishFreeRelease```and ```publishPaidRelease```.
